          ok so im like breaking up with my gf today... i feel bad bc i wasnt really talking to her this morning so she
          probably thinks im just mad at her and she asked me whats wrong and if i wanted to talk about anything and i said i dont know.
          like shes so nice but were not right for eachother u know ? and i tried doing it this morning when i was planning on it, but 
          i couldnt bring myself to do it like i was frozen

          oops forgot to update but it went alright kinda? i did it after class in a semi-secluded area. after i did it i rushed to
          the bathroom and started crying but alexis comforted me shes so sweet.
          i feel really bad saying this but i keep going through phases of liking people? like i go from being unhealthily obsessed to
          not liking them or caring about them. like is that weird or ???
